      <p>
        <strong>James Stephen Ltd. </strong> was formed in 1969 by the late
        James Stephen. After working as a salesman for a global pharmaceutical
        company, he decided to strike out on his own and form his own company
        selling a wide range of household products, food items, wines and
        spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company is now being run by Mr. Stephen's children, namely James
        Stephen, Hilda Stephen and Thomas Stephen and in more recent years the
        decision was made to focus solely on food items, wines and spirits.
